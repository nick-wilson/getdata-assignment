# Code book for the modified Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 

## Summary

Data has been collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy Smartphone and used to track fitness activities of various subjects.

This code book describes the variables produced from that data after processing by the run_analysis.R script.

The website describing the experiment is available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The original data is available from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Please note that the formatting of this file has been designed to be viewed on the Github site. Other implementations of Markdown may not format the table correctly.

## Modifications to the original data

* Only the mean and standard deviations of the measurements were extracted.
* The training and test sets were merged togther.
* The integers used to represent the entries in the activity data set were replaced with their corresponding descriptions.
* The average of each variable for each data set and each subject was calculated.

## Variables
The data table generatedaby the R script from the data set contains the following variables.
